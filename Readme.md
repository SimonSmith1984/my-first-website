# My very first web page

Welcome!

## Project description
This is still in its very early stages and was primarily used for practice in using GIT and GITHUB 
I've learned the importance of version control and how to protect my work. THe challenge asked me to explain the rationale of the project but at the moment I'm assuming the project hasn't started. The primary aim of what I've been doing so far is to introduce me to the basics of Git and Github?
